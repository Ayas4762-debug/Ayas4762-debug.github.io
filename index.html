            <p class="post-decription">Before diving into strength workouts, it's important to understand the basics. Strength training typically involves lifting weights with low to moderate volume and high intensity, focusing on building overall strength and power. Exercises often involve compound movements that target multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press. The goal is to gradually increase the weight and intensity over time, promoting progressive overload and continued strength gains.
